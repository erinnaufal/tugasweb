                        <h1>Magnum</h1>
                        <p>The term "Magnum" refers to a class of powerful and high-performance cartridges commonly used in handguns and rifles. Magnum cartridges are known for their larger case capacity and higher muzzle velocities compared to standard

                        </p>
                        <p>Magnum cartridges are characterized by their ability to deliver increased stopping power, extended range, and improved terminal ballistics, making them popular choices for hunting, target shooting, and self-defense.</p>
                        <p>Magnum handguns, such as the .357 Magnum, .44 Magnum, and .500 Magnum, are widely used by law enforcement agencies, hunters, and civilians for various purposes. They offer greater firepower and penetration compared to traditional

                        <p>In addition to handguns, Magnum cartridges are also utilized in rifles for hunting big game and long-range shooting. Rifles chambered in Magnum calibers, such as the .300 Winchester Magnum and .338 Lapua Magnum, are prized for
                            their accuracy and lethality.</p>
                        <p>While Magnum cartridges offer significant advantages in terms of performance, they also produce greater recoil and muzzle blast, requiring shooters to have proper training and experience to handle them effectively.</p>

                            <li>Deafening Noise: The loud noise produced by the flashbang disorients opponents and can cause temporary hearing loss.</li>
                            <li>Non-lethal: Unlike traditional grenades, flashbangs are designed to incapacitate rather than kill.</li>
                            <li>Quick Deployment: Flashbangs can be thrown quickly and have a short detonation time, allowing for rapid deployment in tactical situations.</li>
